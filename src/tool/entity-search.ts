/**
 * entity_search — the agent's live lookup of what the user is already
 * tracking, so it reuses an existing `[[name]]` instead of creating a
 * near-duplicate.
 *
 * Why a live tool and not injected context: a workspace's context (CLAUDE.md
 * etc.) is written once, at creation time. A long-running workspace would be
 * blind to entities created after it started — so a static "here are the
 * tracked entities" snapshot can't keep dedup honest. This tool reads the
 * store fresh on every call.
